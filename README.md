# Mynes

A simple minesweeper clone, written in Tcl/Tk mainly to learn the tech, but
also just a little for fun. This game is even themable, to some extent (:

This was written circa 2003, if memory serves. Still works, providing you
have Tcl, Wish (the Tcl gui shell) and ITcl installed. On Gentoo, that's
a breeze -- any other reasonable Linux distro should also make it easy. Good
luck on Windows.
